+ Creating Stopwatch project using HTML , CSS , JavaScript.
+ My Stopwatch have Start , Stop and Reset functions .
+ A start button in a stopwatch is typically used to begin the measurement of elapsed time. 
  When you press the start button, the stopwatch starts counting the seconds, minutes, or hours that have passed since the start button was pressed. 
  This is useful for tracking the time it takes to complete tasks or for measuring the duration of events.
+ A stop button in a stopwatch is used to stop the measurement of elapsed time. 
  When you press the stop button, the stopwatch stops counting the seconds, minutes, or hours that have passed since the start button was pressed. 
  This allows you to record the amount of time that has elapsed since the stopwatch was started .
+ A reset button in a stopwatch is used to return the stopwatch to zero and clear any previous measurements. 
  When you press the reset button, the stopwatch will be reset to its initial state, and any previous measurements will be erased.

## APPROACH :
+ First, create an HTML structure for the stopwatch. This can be a simple div element with nested elements for the display and control buttons.
+ Next, style the stopwatch using CSS. This can include styling for the display and control buttons, as well as any additional styling as desired.
+ Create a JavaScript file to handle the stopwatch functionality.
  This file can include variables for the start time and interval ID, as well as functions to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
+ Finally, link the JavaScript file to the HTML document and add any additional styling or functionality as desired.
